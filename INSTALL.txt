Install
-------

Thank you for downloading pylibkml.

To install it, simply place the included `src` directory somewhere on your
Python path, or symlink to the directory from somewhere on your Python path.

For example:
sudo hg clone https://pylibkml.googlecode.com/hg/ /usr/local/pylibkml
sudo sh -c "echo /usr/local/pylibkml/src > /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/pylibkml.pth"
